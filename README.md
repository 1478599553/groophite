# Groophite

## Why 
#### Groophite is a mod which is powerful to tweak minecraft with Groovy scripts (Still WIP). It provides more powerful features :
 - Code suggestions and highlight. (Exactly it's working on IntelliJ IDEA)
 - Incomplete but useful HOT RELOAD, including events and maybe more in the future.
 - Full ZenMethod support.
 - Quite powerful with the whole java & groovy standard code library.
